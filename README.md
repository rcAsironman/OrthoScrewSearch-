# Image Recognition Integration System (IRIS)

IRIS is an open-source framework designed to help developers build AI-powered image search applications with ease. It provides a modular, extensible architecture that handles image capture, processing, search API integration, and result display across web and mobile platforms via Capacitor.

## Vision

The Image Recognition Integration System (IRIS) was created to streamline the development of image search applications. By abstracting common tasks—such as capturing media, communicating with AI-powered search backends, and displaying results—IRIS lets you focus on your app’s unique features instead of boilerplate.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Web app with static export, wrapped for iOS and Android via Capacitor.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between pages, UI components, and backend clients.
- **Configurable Styling & API**: `public/setup.json` controls theming and endpoint URLs without code changes.
- **Persistent History**: Stores previous search images in IndexedDB for offline access.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/oss-slu/image-recognition-integration-system.git
   cd image-recognition-integration-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run in development**:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Build & Export for production**:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   npm run export
   ```

---

## Capacitor Setup

To deploy IRIS as a native app on iOS or Android, follow these steps:

1. **Install Capacitor CLI** (if not already installed):

   ```sh
   npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli --save
   ```

2. **Initialize Capacitor** (one-time, if not done):

   ```sh
   npx cap init
   # Use com.iris.app for App ID and "image-recognition-integration-system" for App Name
   ```

3. **Add Platforms**:

   ```sh
   npx cap add ios
   npx cap add android
   ```

4. **Configure**: The file `capacitor.config.ts` sets your `appId`, `appName`, and `webDir`. By default, `webDir` is `out` (the export directory).

5. **Build & Sync**:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   npm run export
   npx cap copy
   ```

6. **Open & Run**:

   ```sh
   npx cap open ios
   # or
   npx cap open android
   ```

## Configuration (`public/setup.json`)

The file `public/setup.json` contains runtime configuration for theming and API endpoints without code changes:

```json
{
  "cameraButtonColor": "bg-green-500",
  "imageApiUrl": "http://<YOUR_API_HOST>:<PORT>/search",
  "appBackground": "bg-gray-900",
  "cardBackground": "bg-gray-800",
  "textColor": "text-gray-200",
  "headingColor": "text-blue-500",
  "borderColor": "border-gray-700",
  "buttonPrimary": "bg-blue-500 text-white hover:bg-blue-600",
  "buttonSecondary": "bg-slate-700 text-blue-200 hover:bg-slate-600"
}
```

- **cameraButtonColor**: Tailwind class for the camera trigger button.
- **imageApiUrl**: URL of your image search API backend.
- **appBackground**, **cardBackground**, **textColor**, **headingColor**, **borderColor**: Tailwind classes for consistent theming.
- **buttonPrimary**, **buttonSecondary**: Text & background classes for button variants.

Modify values here and reload the app to see changes.

## Project Structure

### Pages (in `/app`)

- `/` (**Home**): Capture or upload images, send to API, and display search results.
- `/about`: Overview of the IRIS framework and project goals.
- `/loginscreen`: User authentication interface (stubbed for POC).
- `/imageGallery`: Interactive gallery showcasing image search examples and sample queries.
- `/previousImages`: View and manage history of previously searched images (stored in IndexedDB).
- `/profile`: User profile and settings page (for future integration).

### Components (in `/app/components`)

- **CameraButton**: Opens device camera or file picker.
- **ImageDisplay**: Renders a single image with metadata.
- **ImageGrid**: Arranges multiple `ImageDisplay` cards in a responsive grid.
- **ImageModal**: Fullscreen modal for viewing image details and search metadata.
- **NavigationBar**: Top-level navigation with links to pages.

### Libraries & Utils

- `lib/modelClient.ts`: API client for communicating with the image recognition backend.
- `utils/indexedDbHelpers.ts`: Helpers for saving/retrieving image records in IndexedDB.
- `types/config.ts`: TypeScript definitions for runtime configuration and theming.
